## Work Experience

Work Experience at EdgePetrol (March 2022 — April 2022)  


After graduating from the Makers Academy I independently sourced a work placement
at Edge petrol, this involved me shadowing numerous developers throughout their
software development department. During my time I was exposed to real world
situations including standup's, agile work flows using Jira, different API's, SQL, SaaS, data
warehouses and 3rd line support including TDD. I gained a wealth of experience during
my time with Edge and obtained some invaluable experience that I can look to as I take
my next step in my Software Development career.

Project Manager at KONFORM UK Limited (September 2019 — August 2021)  

Becoming a project manager was part of my tech journey, taking on this role enabled
me to save the require financial funds in order to retrain into something i was really
passionate about. However, I also learn't a wealth of people skills, often working under
pressure to deadlines. I was also tasked with ensuring projects were kept to a timescale
and materials were ordered which demonstrates time management and prioritisation
skills.

Account Executive at Grayling (April 2017 — August 2019)

During my time at Grayling i was responsible for handling social media accounts for
clients, often using Facebook paid ads and writing content. This role also gave me a first
look at software development which inspired me to take this path in my career.

## Hobbies

- I have played Golf my whole life, this gives me the escape and fresh air i need to clear my mind and reset in order to focus on other aspects of my life.
- In preparation for my career change into software development i built my own PC with zero pre knowledge  of what i was about to undertake, a real learning curve for me and somthing that i am extremly proud of, this enabled me to learn how a computer worked for the ground up and has lead to me being able to fix technical issues when they arrise.
