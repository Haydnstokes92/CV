## Hobbies

- I have played Golf my whole life, this gives me the escape and fresh air i need to clear my mind and reset in order to focus on other aspects of my life.
- In preparation for my career change into software development i built my own PC with zero pre knowledge  of what i was about to undertake, a real learning curve for me and somthing that i am extremly proud of, this enabled me to learn how a computer worked for the ground up and has lead to me being able to fix technical issues when they arrise.
